# RRA EBM / VSDC integration — Excledge CIS

This document describes how Excledge integrates with the Rwanda Revenue Authority
(RRA) Electronic Billing Machine (EBM) via the **VSDC** HTTP API. It reflects the
integration as actually implemented (contracts verified against the RRA reference
sandbox `rraVsdcSandbox3.0.2.war`). Confirm the current wire format with RRA
during certification (`cis_sdc_certification@rra.gov.rw`).

## Deployment shape

- The CIS is a cloud multi-tenant ERP/POS. Each **Organization** holds one TIN.
- Each **Branch** carries its own RRA device credentials — `bhfId`, device serial
  (MRC), SDC id, and an optional per-branch `vsdcUrl`. Org-level `ebmDeviceId` /
  `ebmSerialNo` are a fallback for single-branch tenants.
- Requests go to `EBM_API_URL` (or the branch's `vsdcUrl`), which points at the
  RRA-issued VSDC edge (locally the sandbox WAR, in production the RRA gateway).

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `ENABLE_EBM` | Master switch. When `false`, all fiscal calls short-circuit as success. |
| `EBM_API_URL` | Base URL, no trailing slash. |
| `EBM_API_KEY` / `EBM_API_SECRET` | Sent as `Authorization: Basic base64(key:secret)`, or `Bearer key` if only the key is set. |
| `EBM_SECURITY_KEY` | Sent as the `security_key` header when set. |
| `EBM_ENVIRONMENT` | `sandbox` \| `production`. |
| `EBM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` | HTTP timeout (default 1000 in dev; raise for production). |
| `EBM_USE_MOCK` | `true` → no HTTP; every call returns a synthetic success. Dev only. |
| `EBM_MAX_QUEUE_RETRIES` | Outbox retry ceiling before DEAD_LETTER (default 10). |
| `EBM_PROTOCOL` | `vsdc` (default, this document) or `osdc` (EBM 2.1 via the OSDC WAR). |
| `OSDC_API_URL` / `OSDC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Only for the OSDC path. |
| `VSDC_OFFLINE_BLOCK_MS` | Block new sales after this long without a successful VSDC contact (default 2 h). |

Every request body carries the VSDC envelope: `{ tin, bhfId, sdcId, mrcNo,
dvcSrlNo, ... }` built by `buildVsdcEnvelope()`; lookups also send an incremental
`lastReqDt` (`yyyyMMddHHmmss`).

## Flows

### Device initialization (§58)

`POST /organizations/:org/ebm/initialize` → `initializeVsdcDevice()` calls
`/initializer/selectInitInfo` with `{ tin, bhfId, dvcSrlNo }`. On success it
stores the returned `sdcId` / `mrcNo` / full payload on the branch, checks the
device TIN matches the organization TIN, and seeds the local invoice counter
past `lastSaleInvcNo` so no number is ever re-emitted.

### Sale (POS checkout)

1. The sale commits in one DB transaction together with an **`ebm_outbox`** row
   (transactional outbox, idempotency key `ebm-SALE-<org>-<saleId>`). Inventory
   deduction and the outbox write are ACID.
2. A bounded inline wait (~5 s) runs the outbox worker so the caller learns the
   fiscal status before the receipt is offered.
3. The worker builds `TrnsSalesSaveWrReq` (`buildRraSendReceiptPayload`) —
   `invcNo`, `custTin`, `prcOrdCd`, per-A/B/C/D-band `taxblAmt`/`taxAmt`,
   `itemList`, `receipt` block — and POSTs `/trnsSales/saveSales`.
4. On success the SDC fields (`rcptNo`, `intrlData`, `rcptSign`, `totRcptNo`,
   `sdcId`, `vsdcRcptPbctDate`) are persisted to `ebm_transactions`, the
   electronic journal text is stored, and the receipt becomes printable.
5. On failure the outbox row backs off exponentially and retries; after
   `EBM_MAX_QUEUE_RETRIES` it is DEAD_LETTER. `resultCd 924` (already
   fiscalised) is treated as success.

**The printable receipt is withheld until the outbox row is SUCCEEDED**
(`FiscalizationPendingError` → HTTP 425).

### Refund / void

Both are fresh sales-transaction documents on `/trnsSales/saveSales`:
- Refund — new `invcNo`, `salesSttsCd=05`, `rfdRsnCd`, `orgInvcNo` = original;
  every line mirrors the original with its tax code/amount, amounts negated for
  the printed slip.
- Void — new `invcNo`, `cnclDt`/`cnclReqDt`, `salesSttsCd=04`, `orgInvcNo=0`.

### Stock (§23, §72, §73)

Every non-SALE `inventory_ledger` row is queued (`ebmSyncStatus=PENDING`). A
5-minute batch submits `/stock/saveStockItems` with a real `sarTyCd` (01 import,
02 purchase, 03 return, 04/13 transfer, 06/16 adjustment, 15 discarding) then
`/stockMaster/saveStockMaster` with the item's new on-hand quantity. SALE rows
are never queued — RRA derives stock-out from `saveSales`.

### Purchases (§70, §71)

`/trnsPurchase/selectTrnsPurchaseSales` pulls B2B sales issued to the taxpayer
into `rra_purchases`. The operator confirms each: `confirmRraPurchase()` builds
`TrnsPurchaseSaveReq` (per-band tax, `itemList`) and POSTs
`/trnsPurchase/savePurchases` with `pchsSttsCd=02`, which records the purchase
and its stock-in.

### Import declarations (§66, §67, §68)

`/imports/selectImportItems` pulls declaration lines into `rra_import_items`.
Each pull's request date must be strictly later than the previous one. The
operator classifies + approves/rejects each line:
`/imports/updateImportItems` with `imptItemSttsCd` 2/3; an approval books the
stock-in as an Import.

### Master data (§59, §61, §62, §64, §65)

Codes, item classifications and notices are pulled incrementally by
`rraMasterDataJob` (nightly) and on demand, cached in `rra_codes` /
`rra_item_classes` / `rra_notices`. Customer TIN verification and item
reconciliation are on-demand lookups.

## Response handling

`parseVsdcStatusCode()` carries the full `resultCd` table (`§4.14`); `000` is
success, `001` ("no search result") is a benign empty lookup, everything else is
a typed error surfaced on the row (`lastError` / `errorMessage`) and on the EBM
Outbox screen. `parseVsdcResponse()` maps the `/trnsSales/saveSales` `data`
block; the QR string is composed by the CIS itself
(`ddmmyyyy#hhmmss#sdcId#rcptNo#intrlData#rcptSign`).

## Numbering

`invcNo` is a per-device gapless sequence (`vsdc_device_counters`, keyed by
org + `bhfId`), seeded past the highest number ever accepted (and past RRA's
`lastSaleInvcNo` at initialization). The printed `INV-…` string is cosmetic.
Local-only receipt types (proforma) draw a separate non-fiscal counter pair.
